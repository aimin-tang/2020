Key points:

* "sails new" creates skeleton directories/files.
* assets are under assets/, there are images/, js/, styles/, etc.

* npm install sails-generate-static --save
* sails generate static

Before this, the root request is served by explicit route:

* config/route.js
* views/pages/homepage.ejs

After this, it is served by asset route:
* assets/index.html

The asset pipeline: asset files -> .tmp/public (copied by Grunt, in Gruntfile.js)

relative path, such as images/logo.png is relative to the starting html page.
absolute path is from assets/ (better - always working).

sails-linker: inserts assets/styles, assets/js and assets/templates automatically.
